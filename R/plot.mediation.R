#' Plot the `mediation` object.
#'
#' @param x weighted_mediation object
#' @param plots An indicator of which type of plot is desired. The options are
#'   * `"optimize" or 1` A plot of the balance criteria as a function of the GBM
#'     iteration.
#'   * `"boxplot" or 2` Boxplots of the propensity scores for the treatment and
#'     control cases
#'   * `"es" or 3` Plots of the standardized effect size of the pre-treatment
#'     variables before and after reweighing
#'   * `"t" or 4` Plots of the p-values from t-statistics comparing means of
#'     treated and control subjects for pretreatment variables, before and after
#'     weighting.
#'   * `"ks" or 5` Plots of the p-values from Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics
#'     comparing distributions of pretreatment variables of treated and control
#'     subjects, before and after weighting.
#' @param subset Used to restrict which of the `stop.method`s will be used
#'   in the figure. For example `subset = c(1,3)` would indicate that the
#'   first and third `stop.method`s (in alphabetical order of those specified
#'   in the original call to the mediation function) should be included in the
#'   figure.
#' @param color If `color = FALSE`, figures will be gray scale. Default: `TRUE`.
#' @param model_subset integer
#'   Choose either model A or model M only.
#' @param ... Additional arguments.

#' @method plot mediation
