\usage{
\method{plot}{iptw}(x, plots = "optimize", subset = NULL,
  color = TRUE, timePeriods = NULL, multiPage = FALSE,
  figureRows = NULL, hline = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.8), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{iptw} object.}

\item{plots}{An indicator of which type of plot is desired. The options are
\itemize{
\item \code{"optimize" or 1} A plot of the balance criteria as a function of the GBM
iteration.
\item \code{"boxplot" or 2} Boxplots of the propensity scores for the treatment and
control cases
\item \code{"es" or 3} Plots of the standardized effect size of the pre-treatment
variables before and after reweighing
\item \code{"t" or 4} Plots of the p-values from t-statistics comparing means of
treated and control subjects for pretreatment variables, before and after
weighting.
\item \code{"ks" or 5} Plots of the p-values from Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics
comparing distributions of pretreatment variables of treated and control
subjects, before and after weighting.
}}

\item{subset}{Used to restrict which of the \code{stop.method}s will be used
in the figure. For example \code{subset = c(1,3)} would indicate that the
first and third \code{stop.method}s (in alphabetical order of those specified
in the original call to \code{iptw}) should be included in the figure.}

\item{color}{If \code{color = FALSE}, figures will be gray scale. Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{timePeriods}{The number of distinct time points. If \code{NULL}, this is assumed to be the number
of \code{ps} objects (i.e., the number of distinct time points).}

\item{multiPage}{When multiple frames of a figure are produced, \code{multiPage = TRUE} will print each
frame on a different page. This is intended for situations where the graphical output is being
saved to a file. Default: \code{FALSE}.}

\item{figureRows}{The figure rows, passed to \link{displayPlots}. Default: \code{NULL}.}

\item{hline}{Arguments passed to \code{panel.abline}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}
