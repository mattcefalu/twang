\title{Extract propensity score weights.}
\usage{
get.weights(ps1, stop.method = NULL, estimand = NULL,
  withSampW = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps1}{A \code{ps} or \code{mnps} object.}

\item{stop.method}{Indicates which set of weights to retrieve from the \code{ps} object.}

\item{estimand}{Indicates whether the weights are for the average treatment effect on
the treated (ATT) or the average treatment effect on the population (ATE). By default,
\code{get.weights} will use the estimand used to fit the \code{ps} object.}

\item{withSampW}{Whether to return weights with sample weights multiplied in, if they were
provided in the original \code{ps} or \code{mnps} call. Default: \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of weights.
}
\description{
Extracts propensity score weights from a ps or mnps object.
}
\details{
Weights for ATT are 1 for the treatment cases and p/(1-p) for the control cases.
Weights for ATE are 1/p for the treatment cases and 1/(1-p) for the control cases.
