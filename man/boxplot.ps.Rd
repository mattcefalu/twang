\title{Boxplot for \code{ps} objects}
\usage{
\method{boxplot}{ps}(x, subset = NULL, color = TRUE, time = NULL,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{ps} object}

\item{subset}{If multiple \code{stop.method} rules were used in the \code{ps()} call, \code{subset}
restricts the plots of a subset of the stopping rules that were employed. This argument
expects a subset of the integers from 1 to k, if k \code{stop.method}s were used.}

\item{color}{If \code{FALSE}, a grayscale figure will be returned.}

\item{time}{For use with iptw fits.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments that are passed to boxplot function, which may bepassed to
the underlying \code{lattice} package plotting functions.}
}
\description{
This function produces a collection of diagnostic plots for ps objects.
}
\details{
This function produces lattice-style graphics of diagnostic plots.
