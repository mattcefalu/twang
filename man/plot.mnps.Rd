\usage{
\method{plot}{mnps}(x, plots = "optimize", pairwiseMax = TRUE,
  figureRows = NULL, color = TRUE, subset = NULL,
  treatments = NULL, singlePlot = NULL, multiPage = FALSE,
  time = NULL, print = TRUE, hline = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.8), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{mnps} object.}

\item{plots}{An indicator of which type of plot is desired. The options are
\itemize{
\item \code{"optimize" or 1} A plot of the balance criteria as a function of the GBM
iteration.
\item \code{"boxplot" or 2} Boxplots of the propensity scores for the treatment and
control cases
\item \code{"es" or 3} Plots of the standardized effect size of the pre-treatment
variables before and after reweighing
\item \code{"t" or 4} Plots of the p-values from t-statistics comparing means of
treated and control subjects for pretreatment variables, before and after
weighting.
\item \code{"ks" or 5} Plots of the p-values from Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics
comparing distributions of pretreatment variables of treated and control
subjects, before and after weighting.
}}

\item{pairwiseMax}{If \code{FALSE}, the plots for the underlying \code{ps} fits
will be returned.  Otherwise, pairwise maxima will be returned.}

\item{figureRows}{The number of rows of figures that should be used.
If left as \code{NULL}, twang tries to find a reasonable value.}

\item{color}{If \code{color = FALSE}, figures will be gray scale. Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{subset}{Used to restrict which of the \code{stop.method}s will be used
in the figure. For example \code{subset = c(1,3)} would indicate that the
first and third \code{stop.method}s (in alphabetical order of those specified
in the original call to \code{mnps}) should be included in the figure.}

\item{treatments}{Only applicable when \code{pairwiseMax} is \code{FALSE} and \code{plots} 3, 4, and 5.
If left at \code{NULL}, panels for all treatment pairs are created.  If one level of the treatment
variable is specified, plots comparing that treatment to all others are produced.  If two
levels are specified, a comparison for that single pair is produced.}

\item{singlePlot}{For Plot calls that produce multiple plots, specifying an integer value of
\code{singlePlot} will return only the corresponding plot.  E.g., specifying \code{singlePlot = 2}
will return the second plot.}

\item{multiPage}{When multiple frames of a figure are produced, \code{multiPage = TRUE} will print each
frame on a different page. This is intended for situations where the graphical output is being
saved to a file.}

\item{time}{For use with \code{iptw}.}

\item{print}{If \code{FALSE}, the figure is returned but not printed. Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{hline}{Arguments passed to \code{panel.abline}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}
